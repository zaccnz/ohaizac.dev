    Hi üëã. I am Zac Cleveland, a 21 year old programmer from Auckland, New Zealand. Writing code has been a hobby of
    mine for the past 10 years. It started with writing Minecraft mods in Java (for example,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XQl_SOWx4E" target="_blank">this</a> mod from 2013). After
    learning Java, I was hooked. A few years later, it was obvious to me that programming was what I wanted to do for a
    living. Next, was learning C and C++ to create games, HTML, CSS and JS to create websites, and Python
    for writing scripts in school. Since then, I have learned and toyed with many more programming languages.
</p>
<p>
    At university, I studied a Bachelor of Science at the University of Auckland (2020-2022). This was a double major,
    majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics. Computer Science for my career, and Mathematics for the
    challenge. My spare time was consumed by learning Rust, React, and TypeScript. Well, that and playing Counter Strike
    with my mates ;)
</p>
<p>
    To me, the best part of programming is the problem solving. I find it engaging to write code which
    manipulates inputs to generate some output. My specific interests are backend development,
    performance-critical code and binary security. Binary security (notably console hacking) is especially
    interesting to me, as the exploration of weird systems fascinates me. So far, my favourite programming languages are
    Rust, TypeScript and C. Also of interest to me is Haskell, and other functional launguages.
