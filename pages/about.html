            I am a 21 year old programmer from Auckland, New Zealand. writing code has been a hobby of mine since I was
            11 years old. I started by writing minecraft mods in Java (for example,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XQl_SOWx4E" target="_blank">this</a> mod from 2013). after
            learning Java, I was hooked. a few years later, I knew that programming was what I wanted to do for a
            living. i had started learning C and C++ to create games, HTML, CSS and JS to create websites, and Python
            for writing scripts in school. since then, I have used many more programming languages. so far, my
            favourites are Rust, TypeScript and C. I am also interested in Haskell, although I am not well-versed.

            at university, I studied a Bachelor of Science, majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics. computer
            science for my career, and mathematics for the challenge. in my spare time, I was learning Rust, React, and
            TypeScript. well, that and playing Counter Strike with my mates ;)
        </p>

            to me, the best part of programming is the problem solving. I find it engaging to write code which
            manipulates inputs to generate some output. my specific interests are backend developemnt,
            performance-critical code and binary security. binary security (notably console hacking) is especially
            interesting to me, as I find the exploration of weird systems fascinating.
