I am Zac Cleveland, a software developer living in Auckland, New Zealand. Writing code has been a hobby of mine for the past 10 years. It started with writing Minecraft mods in Java (for example, this mod from 2013). After learning Java, I was hooked. A few years later, it was obvious to me that programming was what I wanted to do for a living. Next, was learning C and C++ to create games.  Then HTML, CSS and JS to create websites.  During school I learned Python for writing scripts. Since then, I have learned and toyed with many more programming languages.

At university, I studied a Bachelor of Science at the University of Auckland (2020-2022). This was a double major, majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics. Computer Science for my career, and Mathematics for the challenge. My spare time was consumed by learning Rust, React, and TypeScript. Well, that and playing Counter Strike with my mates ;)

To me the best part of programming is the problem solving. I find it engaging to write code which manipulates inputs to generate a specified output. My interests are backend development, performance-critical code and binary security. Binary security (notably console hacking) is of high interest to me as the exploration of weird systems fascinates me. So far, my favourite programming languages are Rust, TypeScript and C. Also of interest to me is Haskell and other functional launguages.

Currently I am working at BurgerFuel in Ellerslie as a team member.  Here I am learning customer service and teamwork skills first hand.  In the meantime, between travelling and studying I have been working on various projects that are hosted on this website.  While not a full collection of my projects (in fact, this website barely scratches the surface) they are the projects that I have completed.
