mediasync is an extension built for Chrome, Firefox and Edge
that allows people to watch online video content together.  Playback can be synchronised between any number of
devices, anywhere in the world.  I have developed mediasync with [Gabriel Belcher](https://gabrielbelcher.com), a friend of mine.
