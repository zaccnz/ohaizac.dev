Auto-dark-mode is an application that I created to automatically apply the dark
mode theme when my night light is turned on.  On Windows, you can schedule when the built in
blue-light filter (night light) is turned on.  I have it set to turn on at sunset every day.
However, you can not do the same for the dark theme.  My script solves that issue for me.
